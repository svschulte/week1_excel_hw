week1 Bootcamp homework (excel)
In my homework I was able to help Louisa to work on analysis of campaigns' outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals.
During my work I was able to compare outcomes for all the countries for their fundraising compaigns for the subcategory "Plays". 
Basing on graphic charts, I can conclude, that the most successful month for launching theater campaign is May. The least successful month is December. Basing on statistics, I would not recommend to launch the compaign towards the end of the year.
There were no canceled fundraising compaings for subcategory "Plays". Campaigns with funding goals of range 20000 to 35000 and over 45000 are more successful than other campaigns.
